## Features 
- Import from text file or copy-paste text directly 
- Configure sidetone pitch, speed, Farnsworth timing 
- Save current configuration to use later 
- Choose between basic and advanced config options <br>
**Note:** What is Farnsworth timing? <br>
Farnsworth timing is a method for learning morse code where the individual characters are sent at normal/fast speeds, but the spacing between characters/words are larger. <br> For example, sending "PARIS" at 30wpm with 15wpm Farnsworth timing would mean that the individual letters P, A, R, I, S will send at 30wpm, but the spaces between the characters will be sent at 15wpm.
